# 'GUESS THE WORD'

Game developed by [Carmen L.](https://cgbl-90.github.io/clopez/)

### About

This game fetchs a random word from [Random word API](http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home)
and gives the player 5 attempts to guess the word.
If you guess a letter from the word, it's highlighted, so that you knew it was correct.
